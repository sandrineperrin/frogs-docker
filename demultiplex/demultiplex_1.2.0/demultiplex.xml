What it does

Classify single or paired end reads in function of barcode forward or reverse in the first or both reads.

**Command line**::

  demultiplex.py --input-R1 *FQ_INPUT1* [--input-R2 *FQ_INPUT2*] --input-barcode *TXT_BARCODE* --mismatches *MISMATCH* --end *END* --summary *TXT_SUMMARY_OUTPUT* --output-demultiplexed *TARGZ_DEMULT_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT* --output-excluded *TARGZ_UNDEMULT_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT*

.. csv-table:: Inputs
   :header: "Input name", "Meaning"
   :widths: 20, 80
   :class: table table-striped

   "FQ_INPUT1", "Fastq input file for the first read (single end or forward read of pair end sequences)"
   "FQ_INPUT2", "Fastq input file for the second read (only for pair end sequences)"
   "TXT_BARCODE", "Tabulated text file that describe barcode sequence used to multiplexe sample in your run: SAMPLE_NAME	BARCODE1	[BARCODE2]"

.. csv-table:: Options
   :header: "Option name", "Meaning"
   :widths: 20, 80
   :class: table table-striped

   "-m/--mismatches MISMATCH", "Number of allowed mismatch in each barcode"
   "-e/--end END", "To which end must the barcode be found : forward (begin of the (first) read), reverse (end of the (second) read) or both"

.. csv-table:: Outputs
   :header: "Output name", "Meaning"
   :widths: 20, 80
   :class: table table-striped

   "TXT_SUMMARY_OUTPUT", "A tabulated text file which summarise the number of sequence (pair) for each sample"
   "TARGZ_DEMULT_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT", "A TAR.GZ archive that contains all fastq files for each sample"
   "TARGZ_UNDEMULT_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT", "A TAR.GZ archive that contains all fastq files for undemultiplexed read"

.. class:: h3

Format

BARCODE_FILE : This file is expected to be tabulated:
 -first column corresponds to the sample name
 
 -second one to the sequence barcode used
 
 -optional third one to the reverse sequence barcode.
 
.. class:: warningmark

Take care to indicate sequence barcode in the strand of the read, so you may need to reverse complement the reverse barcode sequence

.. class:: warningmark

Barcode sequence must have the same length
 
example of barcode file. The last column is optional, like this it describes sample multiplexed by both fragment ends.

FASTQ : Text file describing biological sequence in 4 lines format: 
 -first line start by "@" corresponds to the sequence identifier and optionally the sequence description.
 
 -second line is the sequence itself
 
 -third line is a "+" following by the sequence identifier or not depending on the version
 
 -fourth line is the quality sequence, one code per base. The code depends on the version and the sequencer

.. class:: infomark page-header h2

How it works

For each sequence or sequence pair the sequence fragment at the beginning (forward multiplexing) of the (first) read or at the end (reverse multiplexing) of the (second) read will be compare to all barcode sequence.

If this fragment is equal (with less or equal mismatch than the threshold) to one (and only one) barcode, the fragment is trimmed and the sequence will be attributed to the corresponding sample.

Finally fastq files (or pair of fastq files) for each sample are included in an archive, and a report describes how many sequences are attributed for each sample. 


.. class:: infomark page-header h2

Advices

Do not forget to indicate barcode sequence as they actually are in the fastq sequence file, especially if you have data multiplexed via the reverse strand.

For the mismatch threshold, we advised you to let the threshold to 0, and if you are not satisfied by the result try with 1. The number of mismatch depends on the length of the barcode, but oftenly those sequences are very short so 1 mismatch is already more than the sequencing error rate.

If you have different barcode length, you must demultiplex your data in different times beginning by the longest barcode set and used the "unmatched" or "ambiguous" sequence with smaller barcode and so on.

If you have Roche 454 sequences in sff format, you must convert it with some program like `sff2fastq &lt;https://github.com/indraniel/sff2fastq&gt;`_ or sff_to_fastq (installable in Galaxy)
